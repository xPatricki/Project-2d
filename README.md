# ZSKGEON

 This repository contains source code of our own game. Main reason of this project is to pass to the 4rd class in our school, but the other reason is to try our skills in diffrent IT environments.
 
## Game

 The first idea of this is a 2D game, similar to The Binding of Isaac (https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/).
 Game was created in 2020.

## Environments

The game is created in Unity using C#. We are rookies and this is our first steps so all tips are welcome. Most objects are created in Aserpite, where we are rookies too.
